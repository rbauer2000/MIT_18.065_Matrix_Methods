#Lecture 1

Just want to see how to put in python chuck and if assigning value puts into R Global Environment.

```{python}
import math
a = 2 * math.pi
a
```

I didn't put anything in Rcpp because I don't remember how to do main and all that

```{Rcpp}
```

Just for fun, put in bash ls.

```{bash}
ls
```

OK, we enter a 3 x 3 matrix and then to select random vector from column space we create random vector x and then Ax.

```{r}
A <- matrix(data = c(2, 3, 5, 1, 1, 7, 3, 4, 12), nrow = 3)
x <- sample.int(10, size = 3, replace = TRUE)
A %*% x
```
