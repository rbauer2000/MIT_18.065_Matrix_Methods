title: "Section I.3 The Four Fundamental Subspaces"

I did this section in python jupyter notebook, but there are some things that I don't like about python even though I do like scipy packages a little more than just numpy.  But here I am again looking at using R.

The basic data type in R is a vector and there is a matrix also.  So let's see if it is easy to find null space, column space, row space and left null space or null space of $A^T$

```{r}
library(pracma)
```


```{r}
B <- matrix(c(1, 3, -2, -6, -2, -6), nrow = 2, ncol = 3)
B
```
```{r}
ns <- null(B)
ns
cs <- orth(B)
cs
lns <- null(B)
lns
rw <- orth(B)
rw
```
By inspection we can see that Null Space
solutions to $Bx=0$ are 
$x_1 = \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}$
$x_2 = \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$
But these are not prefect vectors to choose since not orthonormal.  These do form bases for null space but are not orthnormal

```{r}

```
